* [go-civitai-downloader](https://github.com/dreamfast/go-civitai-downloader): Easily download and archive content from Civit.ai, supports torrent file generation. (github)
* [btdig](https://btdig.com/): A free search engine for torrent content, great for biglust and other content that may have been purged. BE sure to be mindful of the word filters see issue [#40](https://github.com/btdig/dhtcrawler2/issues/40).
* [damag](https://damag.net/): Another free search engine for torrents, isn't so great for biglust however you may find other models.
* [A curated list](https://fmhy.net/torrenting#aggregators): for torrent aggregators.

Additional alternatives mentioned include:

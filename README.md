# Civitai mirror suggestion list

Try these:

This was mainly a list, if one site doesn't work out (like Tensor.art) try the others.

Sites similar to Civitai, which is a popular platform for sharing and discovering Stable Diffusion AI art models, include several notable alternatives:

* [Tensor.art](https://tensor.art/): A competitor with a significant user base, offering AI art models and tools similar to Civitai.
* [Huggingface.co](http://huggingface.co/): A widely used platform hosting a variety of AI models, including Stable Diffusion, with strong community and developer support.
* [ModelScope.cn](https://modelscope.cn/): is essentially a Chinese counterpart to Hugging Face. It is developed by Alibaba Cloud and offers a similar platform for hosting, sharing, and deploying AI models, including features like model hubs, datasets, and spaces for running models online. ModelScope provides many of the same functionalities as Hugging Face but with a focus on the Chinese AI community and regional models
* [Prompthero.com](https://prompthero.com/): Focuses on AI-generated images and prompt sharing, serving a community interested in AI art generation.
* [Pixai.art](https://pixai.art/): Another alternative praised for its speed and usability compared to Civitai.
* [Seaart.ai](https://www.seaart.ai/): Offers a large collection of models and styles with community engagement, ranking as a top competitor in traffic and features. I'd try this first for checking backups on models or lora's that were pulled.
* [civitarc.com](https://www.diffusionarc.com/): a free platform for archiving and sharing image generation models from Stable Diffusion, Flux, and more.
* [civitaiarchive.com](https://civitaiarchive.com/) A community-driven archive of models and files from CivitAI; can look up models by model name, sha256 or CivitAI links.
* [CivitAI-Model-grabber](https://github.com/Confuzu/CivitAI-Model-grabber): The Script Downloads in bulk both model(Lora,Lycoris,Embeding etc..) and related images, from a given CivitAI Username (github)
* [go-civitai-downloader](https://github.com/dreamfast/go-civitai-downloader): Easily download and archive content from Civitai, supports torrent file generation. (github)

Additional alternatives mentioned include:

* [thinkdiffusion.com](https://www.thinkdiffusion.com/): Provides pro-level AI art generation capabilities accessible via browser, including ControlNet support.
* [stablecog.com](https://stablecog.com/): A free, open-source, multilingual AI image generator using Stable Diffusion.
* [Novita.ai](https://novita.ai/): An affordable AI image generation API with thousands of models for various use cases.
* [imagepipeline.io](https://www.imagepipeline.io/) and [modelslab.com](https://modelslab.com/): Offer advanced APIs and tools for image manipulation and fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model usage.
